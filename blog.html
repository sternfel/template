                <p>1/22/14- The purpose of this video was for the author of the poem, Trevor, to explain his feelings and express his emotions of his uncle’s death. He relates to his uncle in the way of being openly gay. They have both been married and divorced as well as discriminated against because of their sexual preference. It is sad to think that there are many people in the world who bully people enough to where others do not believe there is a better option other than death. This video shows Trevor’s personal experience with his family struggles. They tried to disown him as a son because he is gay. Trevor’s mother told him that there is a hell and that he is going there. These comments are degrading. These are the things that make people feel worthless and push them to become depressed and eventually suicidal. Trevor explains that this is not okay and that everyone should be loved no matter who they are or what their sexual preference is. The structure of Trevor’s message allowed him to link specific events with his feelings. He connected his religious preferences with the hate he as well as his uncle were faced with. They were threatened and bullied which led to his uncle’s death. By watching this video, I realize that I should be more emotional when emphasizing the importance of my piece of technology. I will also look deeper and expand more on the details of the piece of technology and how it made me feel. </p>
                
                <p>1/29/14The group of people targeted in this video are the extreme gamers. These gamers are killing too many players on the World of Warcraft game. There are a few social issues at hand. One is jealousy. There should not be hate for someone that is better at something than you are. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. This is also not the way that you should deal with your problems. If you have a problem with someone, you should contact them civilly and not try to attack them. I am not a South Park fan because I know that the characters seem to be disrespectful to one another and are sometimes immature in their actions.</p>
