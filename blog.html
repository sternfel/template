                <p>The purpose of this video was for the author of the poem, Trevor, to explain his feelings and express his emotions of his uncle’s death. He relates to his uncle in the way of being openly gay. They have both been married and divorced as well as discriminated against because of their sexual preference. It is sad to think that there are many people in the world who bully people enough to where others do not believe there is a better option other than death. This video shows Trevor’s personal experience with his family struggles. They tried to disown him as a son because he is gay. Trevor’s mother told him that there is a hell and that he is going there. These comments are degrading. These are the things that make people feel worthless and push them to become depressed and eventually suicidal. Trevor explains that this is not okay and that everyone should be loved no matter who they are or what their sexual preference is. The structure of Trevor’s message allowed him to link specific events with his feelings. He connected his religious preferences with the hate he as well as his uncle were faced with. They were threatened and bullied which led to his uncle’s death. By watching this video, I realize that I should be more emotional when emphasizing the importance of my piece of technology. I will also look deeper and expand more on the details of the piece of technology and how it made me feel. </p>
