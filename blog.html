                <p>   1/8/14-  This week we did not have class. I was then interested in what projects we would be working on throughout the semester. Throughout the semester, our class has been faced with many different types of projects. Our knowledge on science and technology has expanded beyond limits. Through our extensive time spent on Codecademy and Github, we have gained the knowledge to be able to compile our projects into an online portfolio.  The coding skills are a staple in the new technological era and are crucial that we learn for our own benefit. Although the coding was difficult to pick up at first, we worked through it because it allowed us to complete our final online portfolio project. The following projects we completed this year have exposed us to the many uses of science and technology.   </p>


<p>    1/15/14- This week we started our Lived Experience Projects. I began my paper talking about electronics and educational toys that I played with when I was younger. My story starts when I was a toddler and would play with matching puzzles. These puzzles helped me learn my colors and numbers. When the pieces were put in the wrong slot, there would be a buzzing noise. A dinging noise would sound if I put the pieces in the correct spots. When I was a little bit older, I received a Leap Pad from the popular company Leap Frog Learning Toys. This product came with stories and sing-along books that would snap into the Lead Pad console. This device enhanced my reading abilities by teaching me the sounds and syllables of words, which would later help my reading skills and reading comprehension. By the time I was in my last year of preschool, my teacher made a phone call home to my parents. My mom was extremely surprised to hear my teacher say that most students were not able to read chapter books at age four. My mom thought that it was completely normal. Due to my plethora of educational technology at home, I was able to exceed the average standards of a preschool student.  </p>

                
                <p>1/22/14- The purpose of this video was for the author of the poem, Trevor, to explain his feelings and express his emotions of his uncle’s death. He relates to his uncle in the way of being openly gay. They have both been married and divorced as well as discriminated against because of their sexual preference. It is sad to think that there are many people in the world who bully people enough to where others do not believe there is a better option other than death. This video shows Trevor’s personal experience with his family struggles. They tried to disown him as a son because he is gay. Trevor’s mother told him that there is a hell and that he is going there. These comments are degrading. These are the things that make people feel worthless and push them to become depressed and eventually suicidal. Trevor explains that this is not okay and that everyone should be loved no matter who they are or what their sexual preference is. The structure of Trevor’s message allowed him to link specific events with his feelings. He connected his religious preferences with the hate he as well as his uncle were faced with. They were threatened and bullied which led to his uncle’s death. By watching this video, I realize that I should be more emotional when emphasizing the importance of my piece of technology. I will also look deeper and expand more on the details of the piece of technology and how it made me feel. </p>
                
                <p>1/29/14The group of people targeted in this video are the extreme gamers. These gamers are killing too many players on the World of Warcraft game. There are a few social issues at hand. One is jealousy. There should not be hate for someone that is better at something than you are. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. This is also not the way that you should deal with your problems. If you have a problem with someone, you should contact them civilly and not try to attack them. I am not a South Park fan because I know that the characters seem to be disrespectful to one another and are sometimes immature in their actions.</p>
                
                <p>     2/5/14-  Final Reflection on how computers affect my personal life: Due to many years of being exposed to computers, it is easier for students such as myself to navigate webpages such as OWL and Desire 2 Learn. I have been granted the knowledge to send professional emails to my course instructors and potential bosses. By recollecting the information I absorbed in my brain while playing computer games and sending online messages throughout my childhood, I have been able to excel in the classes that use this material. By taking these classes and doing well in them, I am on my way to achieving my Human Biology degree at Michigan State University and accomplishing my dream of becoming a Physician Assistant.   </p>
                
             <p>  2/12/14-  This week we worked on our Cultural Analysis Project. It really hit home for me when talking about the way 7th Heaven talked about their religion. In the TV Show 7th Heaven, Eric and Annie Camden have 7 children and work together through dilemmas in their family as well as their community. Eric Camden is a Reverend at the local church and Annie is a stay at home mom. They work together as a team to work through various issues to the best of their ability. Throughout 11 seasons, the episodes have featured many hot topics. Some of the topics were controversial such as interfaith marriage and racism. Various topics were based on legal issues such as marijuana usage and spousal abuse. The ones that really hit home were moral issues. What would you do if your son or daughter told you about a homeless teen that they met and wanted to take in to the family home? What if your friend approached you of having suicidal thoughts? In 7th Heaven, the Camden family went above and beyond their duties to help people in need. </p>
             
            <p>   2/19/14-  This week I finished my Cultural Analysis Paper.  I was extremely intrigued by the responses of many online bloggers. An online blogger used an example of how the Camden family used religion to aid in their parenting skills. “In one episode, Eric finds a marijuana joint in the house and immediately suspects Matt but Annie warns him not to run to conclusions. So, Eric and Annie sit all of the kids down and asks them who it belongs to. Eric has a hard time keeping his cool and when Matt admits it was his, Eric doesn't give him a chance to explain. Matt runs out of the house with Eric fuming with anger. Later in the episode, Annie talks to Eric about how he handled the situation. Matt comes home and instead of Eric talking to him, Annie sits him down and has an intimate conversation. Annie discloses that she had smoked marijuana in high school at a party. She tells Matt how her best friend's boyfriend drove after the party and was killed in a car accident. Matt leaves, angry at his mom. At the end of the episode, we find Matt running into their church, sit down, and start praying.”   </p>
            
           <p> 2/26/14-    Formal Research Project: Baby Boomers. As time goes on, the “baby-boomer” generation is becoming older. Their kids are having kids, and so on.  As the natural aging process continues, around 77.3 million citizens are getting to an age where they are in need of more medical attention. As humans age, they accumulate more health issues that require treatment. Currently, we have our highest number of U.S citizens in our history that are between the ages of 50 and 68 years old. This means that the need for all medical personnel, Geriatrics, and knee replacement surgeries will increase in the upcoming years.   </p>



<p>   3/5/14- This week I am on spring break!!!   I interviewed my uncle, Dr. Nicola for my research project. In the interview with Dr. Robert J. Nicola, DDS, he stated, “Over time many things will change, but the human anatomy has been the same for thousands of years. Your teeth, bones and body are created and evolve the same way your ancestors were and your future generations will be. You are always going to need to go to a doctor’s appointment when ill and need to see specialists if you are having a health issue” (Nicola). Dr. Nicola expressed the need to have a professional job and be able to work for yourself. By becoming a Medical Doctor or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, you can have this luxury. If becoming a MD or DO, you are required to go through many years of schooling including getting an undergraduate degree, going to Medical School and also doing a residency with another Doctor. If a Doctor chooses to have a specialty, extra schooling is required. A Doctor has a tight schedule and works many hours, but is also extremely successful on the monetary level. By having the responsibility of being a doctor, you also have the many risks of being sued in a malpractice case.   </p>
  
  
<p>    3/12/14- Tomorrow is my BIRTHDAY! Recent advances in technology allows me to Skype call and text or call my friends and family members who live out of town and live busy lives. I reflect back  to the times before high school when I would use my computer for only minor tasks. In high school, I used my Apple Mac Book for educational as well as social purposes. As president of my youth group, I wrote out weekly emails and many formal messages to my chapter, potential members, parents of members and adult supervisors. It was also important that I created a professional email account that would be used for college applications and job offers in the future. During this time I was only preparing myself for college, where I would need my reading, typing and communication skills more than ever.</p>



<p>     3/26/14- This week I changed my major from Human Biology to kinesiology. This is a smart choice for me. Although the Kinesiology major uses a lot of technology, the Physician Assistant profession. The glamour of the Physician Assistant career is the flexibility. Physician Assistants can choose their own hours and schedule. They are able to balance a family life and social life on top of having a successful career. Many PAs are able to take time off to go on family vacations while a Doctor will have to wait and save up time for an adventure such as that. As well, the time spent to become a PA is shorter then the wait of becoming a MD or DO. You can begin your career as a Physician Assistant after receiving a 4-year undergraduate degree and a 25-month accredited PA program, which is many years before a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine even finishes their schooling. </p>


<p>     4/2/14  GREEK WEEK- I will be working my butt off to finish my Codecademy hours while working on the Final Retrospective Project. I do not think I went to class this week!!! </p>



<p>   4/16/14 Working on Multimedia Project: When organizing our documentary, my group had to meet twice at the library in order to work on both the proposal and final project. It was difficult to create using the video because none of my group members, nor I, have experience using the iMovie software. Our group’s vision was for the audience to understand that technology has its perks but can also be harmful if abused. We chose this topic because we are familiar with the effects of technology. I personally believe that I would be uncomfortable if I was not allowed to use my cell phone for a whole day. The most challenging part of the project was the week that my computer broke. My laptop did not recognize the hard drive and I had to take it in for a repair. I was unable to record the interviews on my computer during this time. It showed me how dependent I am on my computer.      </p>
