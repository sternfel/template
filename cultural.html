			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>It is always interesting to walk into the living room to turn on the television set and see the most recent show that someone in your family has watched. Many times it is a reality TV show, singing competition or dramatic series. A lot of the modern television shows have violent, criminal and immoral themes. Shows that contain underage and excessive drinking habits, lots of vulgar language and bad decision making may have high ratings, but are showing poor examples of how to behave.</p>
			<p> Studies show that the average American child will witness 200,000 violent acts on television by the time they reach the age 18. (Federal Communications Commission) This statistic is based on the various programs that children are watching for hours at a time. If a parent is busy, they can sit their child in front of the television set and they are automatically entertained for hours. When television programs show gang violence, gun violence, drug abuse, or bullying and the characters are not penalized, a percentage of viewers, typically young children may believe that this is acceptable behavior in their own life. The characters that kids see on TV become their role model. If these children are forming new negative morals and standards of right and wrong, bad behavior may be encompassed. </p>
			<p> There are many substitutive shows such as an educational program or shows with appropriate language. These programs are good influences to young ones while they are learning right from wrong. When choosing which television show to watch, it is important for it to show positive ways of life. </p>
