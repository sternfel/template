		<h1>Technology Overload Memo</h1>
		<p>Jordan Sternfeld
</p>By choosing “Technology Overload” as our project theme, we were able to pick something that affected those of all ages. Young children are learning how to speak through educational videos and toys, teenagers are constantly on social media sites and adults use technology for business operations. The television, computer and cellphone are a staple in the college student lifestyle. When interviewing multiple students on campus, our group asked them how often they use their electronics on a daily basis. Most of the students we interviewed said that they were on their phone or computer constantly throughout the day. By having the privilege to check social media sites whenever available, (even when they should be studying or paying attention in class), many students are distracted by technology. This has many negative effects on their schoolwork. <p>
	<p>When organizing our documentary, my group had to meet twice at the library in order to work on both the proposal and final project. It was difficult to create using the video because none of my group members, nor I, have experience using the iMovie software. Our group’s vision was for the audience to understand that technology has its perks but can also be harmful if abused. We chose this topic because we are familiar with the effects of technology. I personally believe that I would be uncomfortable if I was not allowed to use my cell phone for a whole day. The most challenging part of the project was the week that my computer broke. My laptop did not recognize the hard drive and I had to take it in for a repair. I was unable to record the interviews on my computer during this time. It showed me how dependent I am on my computer.  </p>
	<p> The most beneficial research resource we found was the personal interviews. This is because I have similar views on the increase if technology. The least beneficial resources were the articles we found because they were biased based on location of the surveys that gave their statistics. Overall, I believe that my group worked very well together. There were  a few times that some members were uncomfortable do to a language barrier but we were able to strengthen our work by utilizing our differences. Completing this project in a group setting was less stressful than it would have been to do everything on our own. We planned ahead of time so we did not have to do anything last minute. There were a few glitches with the iMovie software, but it should be figured out. If we had more time, I would have tried to work on the presentation of the video. Although our personal interviews are the most effective aspect of the presentation, I would have liked to shorten the span of the videos and added more factual information.</p>
