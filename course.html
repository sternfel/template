		<h2> Course Retrospective Final Project</h2>
		<p>  Throughout the semester, our class has been faced with many different types of projects. Our knowledge on science and technology has expanded beyond limits. Through our extensive time spent on Codecademy and Github, we have gained the knowledge to be able to compile our projects into an online portfolio.  The coding skills are a staple in the new technological era and are crucial that we learn for our own benefit. Although the coding was difficult to pick up at first, we worked through it because it allowed us to complete our final online portfolio project. The following projects we completed this year have exposed us to the many uses of science and technology. </p>


		<p> In the beginning of the semester, our class was introduced to the Lived Experience Project. The Lived Experience Project prompt was asking us to describe one piece of technology that has led us to our chosen fields. As a hopeful Physician Assistant, I chose to talk about the personal computer. I described the evolution of the personal computer throughout my lifetime and how during each chapter of my life, it served a different purpose. It began with our CRT Dell desktop that my family had in the basement office. At my house, I played Barbie computer games, Furby doll computer games and Arthur computer games. My favorite game that we owned was an interactive software called My Amazing Human Body. The educational and fun lessons within the software focused on anatomy and nutrition. This game helped me learn how to eat healthy, where the parts are located in the body and how they function. These lessons served as a prequel to the anatomy, physiology and nutrition classes I have taken and plan to take next year.</p>


		<p> As we moved forward in time, I explained how with each new computer we owned; the software on it became more complex. My dependency on technology increased as I started to use social media sites and instant messaging. I even learned how to type on a Mavis Beacon program that was offered during an elective class at my middle school. The skills I have inquired throughout the past 19 years on the computer will help me further my education into the Medical field. In the Lived Experience Project, I included how many puzzles and electronic toys stimulated my brain to help with memorization and motor skills. I also went into detail on the Leap Frog Learning Pad, which assisted me in learning to read and help my reading comprehension skills.</p>



		<p> Coming on to the scene of the classroom and workplace is technology. On college campuses, students are encouraged to have their own laptop to use for school and home work. To receive attendance points in lecture halls, students are required to rent or purchase an iClicker. This allows a class to register their clickers to their ID number and use it in class to answer multiple choice questions. Business is often taken care of through email and online services. Many banks offer online banking and apps for Apple and Android products to use their services with.</p>


		<p> While thinking about the many uses of technology in our daily lives, I knew I found a great topic for the Multimedia Remix Project. There are many benefits of technology, but also many negative effects. My Multimedia Remix Project group found it important to inform our audience of the ways technology is affecting personal relationships and school work. Being privileged to unlimited access to the internet and social media sites, things can get out of hand. If the privilege is abused, relationships can be harmed and your grades will fall.</p>




		<p> Teens constantly want to know what is going on, but need to take a break. People have become so obsessed with their phones, they can’s even put them down while driving a vehicle. This can cause accidents and even worse, death. As part of our Multimedia Remix Project, my group interviewed several college students on their personal use of technology and their views of how technology is affecting society.</p>


		<p> A couple of the interviewees were led to believe that the newer generations are losing valuable communication skills such as the ability to write a formal letter and have a conversation in person known as people skills. These ways of communication have been replaced with texting, emailing and Skype chats. With that in mind, it is important as adolescents that we teach the younger kids to play outside more and limit their use of personal electronics such as gaming systems as well as iPods and iPads.</p>


	<p> A great example of the way modern families should treat their children is in the television show 7th Heaven. For my Cultural Analysis Project, I used the TV show and related it to the way children are being affected by television. In the TV show 7th Heaven, Eric and Annie Camden have 7 children and work together through dilemmas in their family as well as their community. Eric Camden is a Reverend at the local church and Annie is a stay at home mom. They work together as a team to work through various issues to the best of their ability. Throughout 11 seasons, the episodes have featured many hot topics. They respect their children and their children’s opinions. Watching 7th Heaven growing up, children are exposed to positive lifestyle choices and reprimanding by parents. </p>



		<p> Children who were exposed to violent television shows or even too much television growing up can have an altered sense of right and wrong. These distorted views create moral less behavior. If a parent is busy doing work at home, they can sit their child in front of the television set and they are automatically entertained for hours. When television programs show gang violence, gun violence, drug abuse, or bullying and the characters are not penalized, a percentage of viewers, typically young children may believe that this is acceptable behavior in their own life. The characters that kids see on TV become their role models. Many reviews and online bloggers believe that situations shown on 7th Heaven are extremely exaggerated and fabricated for the viewers. That may be true, but the show emphasizes their strong family bonds and relationships that are lost in families that do not put in enough effort. This is also the case for families whose children spend more time watching TV and on their electronics than talking to family members.</p>



			<p>Although electronics and technology have their negative effects, it is very important that we have these technological advances and skills. The number of job openings in the medical field will be growing exponentially in the next few years. This is because of the baby-boomer generation. As time goes on, the “baby-boomer” generation is becoming older. Their kids are having kids, and so on.  As the natural aging process continues, around 77.3 million citizens are getting to an age where they are in need of more medical attention. As humans age, they accumulate more health issues that require treatment. Currently, we have our highest number of U.S citizens in our history that are between the ages of 50 and 68 years old. This means that the need for all medical personnel, Geriatrics, and knee replacement surgeries will increase in the upcoming years. </p>




				<p> As a student succeeding in many math and science courses at Michigan State University, I have set my dream profession of being a Physician Assistant. You can begin your career as a Physician Assistant after receiving a 4-year undergraduate degree and a 25-month accredited PA program, which is many years before a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine even finishes their schooling. By having these skills, I will be able to help in the near future with the baby boomer generation. I will be able to go home everyday with the personal satisfaction knowing that I helped someone in need.</p>


				<p>As I quoted in my Lived Experience Project, “Over time many things will change, but the human anatomy has been the same for thousands of years. Your teeth, bones and body are created and evolve the same way your ancestors were and your future generations will be. You are always going to need to go to a doctor’s appointment when ill and need to see specialists if you are having a health issue.” This proves that the time spent playing My Amazing Human Body on the old computer when I was a child has the ability to impact my knowledge base for the rest of my life. It also states that having a profession in the medical field will pay off in the end. </p>



				<p> In conclusion, science and technology affect our daily lives for better and for worse. It was interesting to see how we can use technology every day from birth to death through medical advances and educational supplies. Around the world, we are thankful to have so many technological advances used for communication and in medicine.</p>
