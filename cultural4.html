			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p> Many viewers felt uncomfortable siding with all of the events in the episodes of the  7th Heaven TV show. Their morals would get in the way with what the Camden family chose to do, or what opinion they would express with the viewers. If viewers were not religious, they felt that they could not relate to some events or decisions made. That is what makes our society diverse. My position on this issue is that people should be able to express their religion and views where ever, when ever, as long as it is not harming other people.</p>
			<p> Looking back on the show years later, many viewers think of the program as cheesy. One review was titled “laughingly bad, yet oddly mesmerizing” (Rous). This is because, even though the acting was not Emmy Award worthy, it still allowed young viewers to shape good morals and learn right from wrong. </p>
			<p>The Camden family design is very traditional and differs from many of the various family setups in modern day America. Today, there are many single parent households and divorced parent families. This is due to many personal and economical reasons. These family structures have become more common in the past few decades and are also shown on the TV show 7th Heaven. </p>
