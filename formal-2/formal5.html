			<p>According to Jessica Sherbin, a Research Assistant in the Cardiovascular Lab at the University of Michigan, the Physician Assistant profession is wonderful job for young hopeful students. During her time researching in the lab, Jessica viewed statistics of the relationship between patients who were undergoing cardiac rehab and if it was beneficial to their future health/outcome. By undergoing rehab and focusing on getting well while having one on one care with many medical professionals, they were able to heal faster. Throughout her life, Jessica had many injuries and is hoping to fulfill her dreams of becoming a Physician Assistant specializing in Orthopedics. Jessica has been an athlete all of her life and wants to give back to those who helped her. She states, “Becoming a Physician Assistant will allow me to give patients similar help to the help I received.” Jessica was also interested in becoming a Physician Assistant due to her interest in the science and math fields.
As Jessica explained, many people choose to go into the Medical field because of personal experiences. The medical personnel who took care of many patients through their pain and recovery inspire them to help others in a similar situation. The same goes for if someone is inspired through another person’s battle. A good example when a child’s parent goes through the traumatic experience of finding out that they have cancer and going through treatment. They are then motivated to become an oncologist in order to fix those patients whom have children. In this way, Physician Assistants, Medical Doctors and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine as well as other professionals are role models to students.
