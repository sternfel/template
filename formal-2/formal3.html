			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>In a recent interview with Dr. Robert J. Nicola, DDS, he stated, “Over time many things will change, but the human anatomy has been the same for thousands of years. Your teeth, bones and body are created and evolve the same way your ancestors were and your future generations will be. You are always going to need to go to a doctor’s appointment when ill and need to see specialists if you are having a health issue” (Nicola). Dr. Nicola expressed the need to have a professional job and be able to work for yourself. By becoming a Medical Doctor or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, you can have this luxury. If becoming a MD or DO, you are required to go through many years of schooling including getting an undergraduate degree, going to Medical School and also doing a residency with another Doctor. If a Doctor chooses to have a specialty, extra schooling is required. A Doctor has a tight schedule and works many hours, but is also extremely successful on the monetary level. By having the responsibility of being a doctor, you also have the many risks of being sued in a malpractice case. By the time a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine is settled in their work environment, they are usually in their early to mid 30’s. To some, this could be the perfect time to settle down, get married and start a family. On the other hand, many people are looking for a similar approach to a career in the medical field where they can go to school and work while also being during a prime of their life.		
Titled as the “up and coming profession”, Physician Assistants are destined for growth. Physician Assistants (PAs) work under a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine but have similar, if not the exact same roles in everyday life. According to an article on Physician Assistant Satisfaction, many PAs are satisfied with their relationship with their corresponding Physician (Angielczyk, 1997). This is similar to an intimate relationship because in order to be successful, you and your partner must have good communication skills and be able to work together. Also, if there is a disagreement, both PAs and Physicians need to have effective problem solving skills. Physician Assistants are able to have their own patients, write prescriptions and assist in surgery. Physician Assistants are able to practice their work in various settings such as a doctor’s office, clinic, and even in hospitals in places such as the emergency room.
