			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Formal Research Project: Career in the Medical field
In 1939, 16.5 million U.S. men and women set off to places such as Germany, France and the South-Pacific Islands in defense of our country. This was the beginning of World War II.  Married women in America were worried about how they were going to start and raise their family. To solve this problem, many couples conceived a baby before they left for battle. The mother was then left alone during her pregnant months and sometimes even for the labor of their child. As a result of being born during and close after wartime, those citizens are a part of the “baby-boomer” generation.
