			<p>A Physician Assistant is a great profession for someone in the younger generation if they want to pursue a career in the medical field, yet not something as intensive as being a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Both PA and MD/DO are able to have a successful household where they can raise a family, take vacations and have luxurious items. Whether you choose to be a Physician Assistant, Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, it is important to be passionate about what you want to do. Everyone should be happy and excited to go to work every morning. This is why students are encouraged to seek information on different careers while in school. In some areas, people have a ton of valuable resources to explore in hopes of finding what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is better to waste time shadowing someone in a professional field than waste time and money going through schooling and realizing that you do not like what you just put a ton of effort into. </p>
