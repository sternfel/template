			<p>PA’s are very beneficial to a MD or DO because of their extensive research and up to date knowledge on many topics. When in a Physician Assistant program, students spend their first year in a classroom setting focusing on topics such as anatomy, physiology and medical terminology and technology. They then spent their second year doing “rounds” where you are working in a clinical setting working in a plethora of specialty areas for a few months at a time. This gives Physician Assistants a wide spread of experience that many other medical professionals do not receive. PAs also help expand a Doctors practice by increasing the intake of patients they have and how many they can see at a give time in the office.
The glamour of the Physician Assistant career is the flexibility. A recent study on PA’s stated, “I don’t have to only have a work life. I can have a personal life as well.” Physician Assistants can choose their own hours and schedule. They are able to balance a family life and social life on top of having a successful career. Many PAs are able to take time off to go on family vacations while a Doctor will have to wait and save up time for an adventure such as that. As well, the time spent to become a PA is shorter then the wait of becoming a MD or DO. You can begin your career as a Physician Assistant after receiving a 4-year undergraduate degree and a 25-month accredited PA program, which is many years before a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine even finishes their schooling. Both Physician Assistant programs and Medical school are part of a competitive nature where you must prove your drive and motivation in doing what you want to do.

According to Forbes List, a PA makes a very good living - earning a median of $80,000 in his or her first year out of school, which although it is less than a leading Physician, is double or even triple what the average 25 year old full-time salary is. Females have gained an attraction to the career for many reasons. The number of females going into the Physician Assistant profession has increased a lot in the past 30 years. According to the graph below, after the 1970s, the number of female PAs succeeded the number of male PAs. Women now compromise over 60% of PAs in the United States (Lindsay, 2008). 
 
Some female PAs viewed feminization of the Physician Assistant career as negative because they were concerned that the respect associated with the profession would be lost as the proportion of men declined. While the “baby-boomer” generation was growing up, they did not see many Physician Assistants and female PAs were scarce. Due to this stereotype and many prejudicial attitudes, older people today might hold off or be upset with the thought of seeing a PA instead of a MD or DO. They are used to the doctor with coat, stethoscope and black bag making a house call when they are sick. Baby-boomer Audree Horwitz of West Bloomfield, Michigan believes that “seeing a Physician Assistant is just as helpful as seeing a Medical Doctor.” After a hip-replacement and many months of surgery recovery, physical and occupational therapy and appointments with all PAs, MDs and Dos, she successfully recovered.
