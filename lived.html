		<p>Are you caught up with the Jones’? Do you have the newest technological and educational supplies? The strong relationship between technology and education can help one achieve success in their careers. As we move forward in time, there are more and more opportunities for young people to expand their knowledge on computers. We are now offered majors in the health and science fields, which require computer skills. To be an adequate competitor in such fields, we must have a lot of experience both in and out of the classroom. In my generation, most of our prior knowledge of computers comes from our childhood. In my home, we have owned a variety of electronics that are also used for educational purposes. </p>
		<p>My story starts when I was a toddler and would play with matching puzzles. These puzzles helped me learn my colors and numbers. When the pieces were put in the wrong slot, there would be a buzzing noise. A dinging noise would sound if I put the pieces in the correct spots. When I was a little bit older, I received a Leap Pad from the popular company Leap Frog Learning Toys. This product came with stories and sing-along books that would snap into the Lead Pad console. This device enhanced my reading abilities by teaching me the sounds and syllables of words, which would later help my reading skills and reading comprehension. By the time I was in my last year of preschool, my teacher made a phone call home to my parents. My mom was extremely surprised to hear my teacher say that most students were not able to read chapter books at age four. My mom thought that it was completely normal. Due to my plethora of educational technology at home, I was able to exceed the average standards of a preschool student.</p>
	<p>The most influential piece of technology we owned was the desktop computer. When I was younger, I could not be separated from the gray CRT Dell desktop that we stored in my basement. It was huge! Of course it helped that there was a plush rolling office chair at that desk. At my house I played Barbie computer games, Furby doll computer games, Arthur computer games, etc. I could be entertained for many hours at a time. My favorite game that we owned was an interactive software called My Amazing Human Body. This game was created by the well-known company Dorling Kindersley and featured an animated skeleton. The educational and fun lessons within the software focused on anatomy and nutrition. It taught me about the various organs of the body. First, I would click on a part of the body. Then, the animated skeleton named Seemore Skinless would name the body part as well as explain its structure and function. As a young child, I was overwhelmed to think that all of these parts were inside of me. At the same time, I was stoked, amazed and wanted to learn more! There was also a game based on a healthy lifestyle as Seemore Skinless counted calories of nutritious foods and showed how daily exercise can help your physical health. </p>
	<p>After retiring our chunky old computer, my family moved on to a flat screen computer. This computer took up less desk space and allowed us to complete other work while also online. This is also the first computer my family owned that did not use dial up internet service. I was saving a lot of time by being able to click on Internet Explorer and just going to the AOL web page instead of opening up the AOL application and hearing it dial up. By having high-speed internet, it was easier and more convenient for me to do my online research homework. In second grade while doing a project on Panda bears, it was required for us to have internet resources as well as resources from books and the encyclopedia.</p>	
	<p>On my twelfth birthday, I purchased an Apple Mac Book. As a sixth grader, there was not a lot of need for me to have my own personal computer. I used it for mostly social purposes such as taking pictures on Photobooth and instant messaging my friends from school, camp and extracurricular activities. Through hours of instant message chats, I became superb at typing on the keyboard. My typing skills were tested in my Personal Computing class when we used a Mavis Beacon program. The goal was for students to be able to leave the class typing on a keyboard while looking at the screen, not down at their fingers. Little did I know, this skill would help me immensely while typing papers in high school and college.</p>
	<p>In high school, I used my Apple Mac Book for educational as well as social purposes. As president of my youth group, I wrote out weekly emails and many formal messages to my chapter, potential members, parents of members and adult supervisors. It was also important that I created a professional email account that would be used for college applications and job offers in the future. During this time I was only preparing myself for college, where I would need my reading, typing and communication skills more than ever.</p>	
	<p>I am currently a Human Biology major at Michigan State University. After graduating from MSU, I plan to go on for more schooling and become a Physician Assistant. I’ve known that I want to go into the medical field since I was a young girl. Being influenced by my uncle and other relatives, I have come to realize that I want to be in a professional field, and still enjoy my work. In many of my high school and college courses, I have needed to recall my knowledge of the anatomy of the human body. When labeling diagrams and dissecting animals in Human Biology, AP Biology and BS 161 courses, I refer to the back of my memory where I have stored that information. This has been previously learned while playing My Amazing Human Body video game. In my EAD and WRA classes, I am required to write lengthy papers that are completed more efficiently because of my excellent typing skills. I can also browse social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter on my laptop. These sites have created groups that allow me to connect with others at Michigan State University who are in the medical field and are taking, or have already taken, similar courses. Additionally, I also use my laptop for ordering deliveries from near by restaurants; but that’s another story.</p>
	<p>Due to many years of being exposed to computers, it is easier for students such as myself to navigate webpages such as OWL and Desire 2 Learn. I have been granted the knowledge to send professional emails to my course instructors and potential bosses. By recollecting the information I absorbed in my brain while playing computer games and sending online messages throughout my childhood, I have been able to excel in the classes that use this material. By taking these classes and doing well in them, I am on my way to achieving my Human Biology degree at Michigan State University and accomplishing my dream of becoming a Physician Assistant. </p>
