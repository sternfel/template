			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>It is important to surround the younger generations with positive influences. They should be banned from television programs that show inappropriate behaviors. In order to shield them from these shows we must monitor their television more closely. It is important if you have children living in your house to monitor the shows that they are watching. If you are not home, than you can set parental locks on certain channels that show such programs</p>
			<p> We can also solve this issue by teaching children that violence is not ok, even if they see it on television. It is also important to stress the diversity of family structures and encourage others to be open-minded. Proposals for education of a variety of religions will be enforced because America is a melting pot. It is important to accept diversity and not to judge others because they are different. </p>
