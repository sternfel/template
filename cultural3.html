			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>In the TV Show 7th Heaven, Eric and Annie Camden have 7 children and work together through dilemmas in their family as well as their community. Eric Camden is a Reverend at the local church and Annie is a stay at home mom. They work together as a team to work through various issues to the best of their ability. Throughout 11 seasons, the episodes have featured many hot topics. Some of the topics were controversial such as interfaith marriage and racism. Various topics were based on legal issues such as marijuana usage and spousal abuse. The ones that really hit home were moral issues. What would you do if your son or daughter told you about a homeless teen that they met and wanted to take in to the family home? What if your friend approached you of having suicidal thoughts? In 7th Heaven, the Camden family went above and beyond their duties to help people in need.</p>
			<p> By voicing their opinion and doing what they think is right, the Camden parents are expressing positive values in which they hope to pass on to their seven children. Children must feel close to their parents in order to open up to them. In 7th Heaven, the Camden children have an ideal relationship with Eric and Annie, which allows them to trust their parents and their judgments. This bond strengthens their family and allows them to be happier and not feel guilty or embarrassed about things going on in their lives.</p>
			<p> An online blogger used an example of how the Camden family used religion to aid in their parenting skills. “In one episode, Eric finds a marijuana joint in the house and immediately suspects Matt but Annie warns him not to run to conclusions. So, Eric and Annie sit all of the kids down and asks them who it belongs to. Eric has a hard time keeping his cool and when Matt admits it was his, Eric doesn't give him a chance to explain. Matt runs out of the house with Eric fuming with anger. Later in the episode, Annie talks to Eric about how he handled the situation. Matt comes home and instead of Eric talking to him, Annie sits him down and has an intimate conversation. Annie discloses that she had smoked marijuana in high school at a party. She tells Matt how her best friend's boyfriend drove after the party and was killed in a car accident. Matt leaves, angry at his mom. At the end of the episode, we find Matt running into their church, sit down, and start praying.” (Sociology Perspectives Group)</p>
